PlotKM <- function(data, model.name) {

  ## Plots the Kaplan-Meier curves for the passed data frame.
  ##
  ## Args:
  ##   data: Data frame which consists of at least three columns with the group 
  ##         (values 1 and 2) in the first,
  ##         status (1 = event, 0 = censored) in the second
  ##         and event time in the third column.
  ##   model.name: Name of the used model for estimation.
  ##
  ## Returns:
  ##   Plots the Kaplan-Meier curves
  ##   being the first component in an 1 x 2 array
  ##   in which the second component is still empty.
