  ## Args:
  ##   data1: Data frame which consists of at least three columns with the group
  ##          in the first (all of group 1),
  ##          status (1 = event, 0 = censored) in the second
  ##          and event time in the third column.
  ##   data2: Data frame which consists of at least three columns with the group
  ##          in the first (all of group 2),
  ##          status (1 = event, 0 = censored) in the second
  ##          and event time in the third column.
  ##   a1.hat: Maximum likelihood estimator for a1.
  ##   b1.hat: Maximum likelihood estimator for b1.
  ##   c1.hat: Maximum likelihood estimator for c1.
  ##   a2.hat: Maximum likelihood estimator for a2.
  ##   b1.hat: Maximum likelihood estimator for b2.
  ##   c2.hat: Maximum likelihood estimator for c2.
  ##   group1.name: Expression for group 1.
  ##   group2.name: Expression for group 2.

  ## Results:
  ##   Plots the survival curves
  ##   under the non-mixture model with Gamma type survival
  ##   in an 1 x 2 plot array
  ##   in which the first component consists of the Kaplan-Meier curves
  ##   and the second component is still empty.
